EquationRunner class:
1. Import the Scanner class in this class
2. allow the user to import two coordinate points in a string c.
3. Use string methods to parse out the x and y values
- after scanning inputs do Integer.parseIntpoint1.split(“,”[0].trim()) twice for each coordinate and for the y1 do [1] for the second pair do point.2.
4. Create a new LinearEquation object with the inputs of x1,x2,y1,y2
5. Do print statements displaying the coordinates, the equation, the slope, the yIntercept,and the distance(by calling the method)
6. Ask the user to enter a third x value and scan it
7. Then print it with the findYValue method


LinearEquation class: (no print statements)
variables:
Private int x1 - variable represents the first x coordinate inputted
Private int x2 - variable represents the second x coorinate inputted
Private int y1 - variable represents the first y coordinate inputted
Private int y2 - variable represents the second y coordinate inputted
Private double slope
Private double yIntercept
Private double distance


LinearEquation object with (x1, x2, y1, y2) as parameter
Use this. For each parameter
calculateDistance
calculateYIntercept
calculateSlope


(note the distance, slope,and yintercept methods will be private void as they are referred back to)
calculateDistance method - calculates the distance from one coordinate to the other and round to nearest hundredth
distance = Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2)
distance = math.squrt(distance)
Distance = Math.round(distance * 100.0) / 100.0


calculateSlope method - calcuates the slope of the coordinates and round to nearest hundredth
double slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)


calculateYintercept method - finds the y intercept using the coordinates and round to nearest hundredth
yIntercept = y1 -slope * x1


findYValue method - uses x3 as a parameter and saves as double and returns string
double yValue = slope * x3 +yIntercept
Double yValue = Math.round(y * 100.0)/ 100.0
Return String.format(“(%.2f, %.2f)”, x3,yValue)


writeEquation method -also a string
String writeSlope
If slope == int slope
writeSlope = Integer.toString((int) slope)
Else
writeSlope = Double.toString(slope)

String writeYIntercept
If yIntercept == int yIntercept
writeYIntercept = Integer.toString((int) yIntercept)
Else
writeYIntercept = Double.toString(yIntercept)

Return “y = “ + writeSlope + “x + “ + writeYIntercept
